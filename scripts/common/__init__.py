"""Shared library for the gnw-chainloader debug/asset tooling.

This package is the DRY foundation for the consolidated debug tools in
``scripts/debug/`` (``extract.py``, ``assets.py``, ``inspect.py``, ``render.py``,
``romcheck.py``, ``findtiles.py``, ``fastcap.py``). It centralises the
logic that used to be copy-pasted across ~70 one-off scripts:

- :mod:`flashio`  — flash/backup loading, decryption, and the known-offset registry.
- :mod:`nesgfx`   — NES CHR 2bpp decoding, iNES parsing, metasprite layouts, G&W tiles.
- :mod:`palette`  — BGRA->RGB conversion, NES master palette, colour-frequency helpers.
- :mod:`compress` — zlib-block scanning and LZMA inflation with header reconstruction.
- :mod:`imaging`  — PNG tile grids (plain/labelled), ASCII tile art, BMP, sprite assembly.
- :mod:`device`   — OpenOCD backend context manager + framebuffer read (hardware only).

All file paths passed to these helpers are resolved relative to the repository root
(see :data:`REPO_ROOT`), so the tools work regardless of the current directory — unlike
the originals, which assumed the CWD was the repo root.

# Always run gnwmanager in debug verbosity. GNWMANAGER_OPENOCD_DEBUG=1 is not just for
# logging: it spawns the thread that drains openocd's stderr pipe (openocd is launched
# stdout=DEVNULL, stderr=PIPE). Without that drain the ~64 KB stderr buffer fills, openocd
# blocks on write(), and the host<->probe transfer deadlocks (it looks like a "hang" but
# is pure host-side plumbing, not the hardware). GNWMANAGER_VERBOSITY=debug then surfaces
# those drained lines + gnwmanager's own logs. setdefault so an explicit override still
# wins, but the safe default is debug-everywhere. Set before any OpenOCDBackend is opened.

# (external_flash_size - offset) and grows it downward, so a host tool must pass the distance

# end of flash" assumption — the ROM cache now occupies that tail).
